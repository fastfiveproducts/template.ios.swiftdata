# template Changes

## 🌿 Branch Structure & Change Approach
- `develop` is the working/integration branch, where multiple feature branches get squash-merged
- `main` is the release/production branch, containing a clean linear history with one commit per release
- see your `OPERATE Developer Pipeline` document for detailed instructions

## 🛤 Contribution Workflow
Make feature branches from `develop` to work from; when that work is complete:
- rebase any changes that may have happened to `develop` back into your feature branch
- squash the feature branch commits into `develop` as one commit via a GH PR

When ready to release (`develop` to `main`):
- squash all of `develop`'s commits since last release
- make that one single commit on top of `main`

Results:
- `main` reflects the released state via a clean linear history with one commit per release
- but because the commit hashes will always differ between `main` and `develop`, git and GitHub sees `main` and `develop` as diverged (even though the content is equal after every release)
